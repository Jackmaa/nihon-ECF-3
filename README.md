# 🌐 **NIHON**

✨ **Why NIHON? What does it mean?**

Nihon is an online manga library designed to provide an organized and user-friendly way to explore and manage your favorite manga. The name Nihon was chosen as a play on words: in Japanese, Hon (本) means "book," and we wanted a name that reflects both our passion for manga and its cultural origins.
